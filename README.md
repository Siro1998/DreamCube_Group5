# DreamCube Boilerplate Project

This program known as the _Pitch_ is the main software component needed to run for the _DreamCube's_ interactive virtual reality room. The main attraction is an arcade-style ball game using a physical ball tracked in three-dimensions. This repo contains two simple example scenes for modes of interaction.

_For additional details about this project as a whole, you should refer to the ~~Dreamcube Handbook~~

#### Setting up Serilog

OpenUPM is used for [Serilog.Sinks.Unity3D](https://openupm.com/packages/com.serilog.sinks.unity3d/)
cd into your project and install then unity sink
`openupm add com.serilog.sinks.unity3d`

See the [manifest file](https://github.com/local-projects/dreamcube.itp.pitch.example.unity/blob/main/Packages/manifest.json)  
for additional packages installed through Unity's package manager.

<!-- Installation -->

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/local-projects/dreamcube.itp.pitch.example.unity.git
cd dreamcube.itp.pitch.example.unity
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Set the configuration file:

An external settings file is required. It's located at `StreamingAssets\general_config.json`.
If the file does not exist it will be created using the default values at first run.

`SignalRUri` - URI of Game Center SignalR server <br />
`DreamCube` - Name of assigned DreamCube <br />
`Debug` - Whether the app is in debug mode <br />
`RTLSLocalIP` - IP of the computer's NIC running this software to which you want to bind RTLS <br />
`RTLSRemoteIP` - IP of the RTLS Server <br />
`RTLSPort` - Port of the RTLS <br />
`LogDirectory` - Serilog file directory <br />
`LogLevel` - Serilog minimum log level <br />
`LogName` - Serilog base file name and extension <br />
`UseASIO`- Audio output to the DSP <br />
`ASIODriverIndex`- Audio output Index <br />
`AsioAutoDetectName` - Audio output name <br />
`DSPBufferLength` - DSP Buffer length <br />
`DSPBufferCount` - DSP Buffer Count <br />

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

1. Open the project with [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). It will prompt you to download the correct version of the Unity editor.
2. Open the `Assets\_DemoApp\Scenes\Base Scenes\Main_Demo.unity` scene.
3. Build the project according to [Unity's documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PublishingBuilds.html).
4. Create your own repo, 

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

_The program does not show on the correct displays._<br />
In the Windows or GPU display manager, the displays should be tiled left to right with indices 1-4. Display 1 should set to the `primary screen`.

For more detail, you should refer to the ~~Dreamcube Handbook~~
