# DreamCube Train To Win Project

This program known as the _Pitch_ is the main software component for the _DreamCube's_ interactive virtual reality room. The main attraction is an arcade-style ball game using a physical ball tracked in three-dimensions. It features surround video and audio cut scenes to create guided stories through championship seasons.

`RTLSLocalIP` - IP of the computer's NIC running this software to which you want to bind RTLS <br />
`RTLSRemoteIP` - IP of the RTLS Server <br />
`RTLSPort` - Port of the RTLS <br />
`LogDirectory` - Serilog file directory <br />
`LogLevel` - Serilog minimum log level <br />
`LogName` - Serilog base file name and extension <br />
`UseASIO`- Audio output to the DSP <br />
`ASIODriverIndex`- Audio output Index <br />
`AsioAutoDetectName` - Audio output name <br />
`DSPBufferLength` - DSP Buffer length <br />
`DSPBufferCount` - DSP Buffer Count <br />


```
{
  "DreamCube": "1",
  "Debug": false,

## Usage




<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->

## Troubleshooting

_The program does not show on the correct displays._<br />
In the Windows or GPU display manager, the displays should be tiled left to right with indices 1-4. Display 1 should set to the `primary screen`.
